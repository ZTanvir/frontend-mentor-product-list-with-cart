## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- We can bundle similar type of states into a function
  using react useReducer.
- UseContext allow us to share state globally.
- When to use useCallback and useMemo ,Memo .And in the most of the case optimization is not needed.

### Useful resources

- [React doc](https://react.dev/) - This helped me to read more about useContext and useReducer hook in react.
